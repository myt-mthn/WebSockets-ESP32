# WebSockets-ESP32

This repository provides a structured and technically grounded introduction to implementing WebSocket communication using the ESP32 platform. It is designed for developers who want to understand WebSockets conceptually and practically using the Arduino framework.  

The repository contains documentation (PDFs) explaining the WebSocket protocol, ESP32 implementation methods, use cases, and design considerations. Corresponding example code will be added progressively to demonstrate each concept in practice.

## Project Overview

WebSocket is a full-duplex communication protocol that allows persistent, bidirectional data exchange between a client and a server over a single TCP connection.

Unlike traditional HTTP request/response transactions, WebSockets enable continuous, event-driven communication, making them ideal for:

- Real-time dashboards  
- Live sensor data streaming  
- IoT device control  
- Device-to-device communication  
- Browser-to-microcontroller interfaces  

This repository bridges theory and implementation through a combination of conceptual documents and ESP32-based hands-on examples.

### Repo pdf's
Includes detailed PDF manuals covering:

- WebSocket fundamentals
- WebSocket Implementation
- ESP32 as a WebSocket server  
- ESP32 as a WebSocket client  
- ESP32-to-ESP32 WebSocket communication  
- HTML + JavaScript WebSocket browser client
